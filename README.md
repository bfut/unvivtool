# unvivtool
unvivtool is a VIV/BIG decoder/encoder for BIGF, BIGH, and BIG4 archives.
unvivtool is available as command-line interface and as Python extension module.
It is based on a dependency-free header-only library written in C89.
Python bindings are written in CPython.
Supported on Windows and Linux. Tested on macOS.

Purported VIV/BIG archives can contain faulty or manipulated header information.
unvivtool is designed to validate and recover data as much as possible.
The decoder performs a single pass buffered read of the archive header only; content extraction is optional.

Developers can drop-in and use, the encoder/decoder and some data analysis functions from ``libnfsviv.h``.

## Features
* memory usage typically peaks below 20 kB even for large archives; worst case ~25 MB
* decode and encode archive
* validate archive
* decode entire archive
* encode files in specified order
* support UTF8 names in archive
* drag-and-drop mode for command-line interface
* option: auto-rename duplicated filenames on decode
* option: retrieve a single file from archive (by index or filename)
* option: list archive contents without writing to disk (dry run)
* option: support non-printable filenames in archive (Base16 representation)
* option: decode/encode with set fixed directory entry length
* Win98 compatibility

## File format
The supported archive formats are called ``BIGF``, ``BIGH``, ``BIG4``, ``0x8000FBC0``, and ``wwww`` (equals first 4 bytes).<br/>
The first four are variants of each other, the last is a precursor.
All are derived from ``EA IFF 85`` (see [2]).<br/>
Archives can be arbitrarily large and can contain arbitrarily many entries.<br/>
Typical file extensions are ``.VIV`` and ``.BIG``.<br/>
