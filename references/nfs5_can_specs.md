# Unofficial CAN File Format Specification (.can)
Unknown purpose.  Part of NFS:PU (PC, 2000).  Known examples are archived in the
`GameData/Track/Data/track##a.viv` (##=00, 02..10) set.
```C++
struct Header {
/* 0x0 */  uint16_t  filesize;  /* big endian */
/* 0x2 */  uint8_t   unknown;  /* 03 */
/* 0x3 */  uint8_t   unknown[5];  /* null */
/* 0x8 */  uint16_t  unknown;  /* ? variable */
/* 0x9 */  uint16_t  unknown;  /* 06 00 */
};
// sizeof(Header) == 12 (0xC)
```
